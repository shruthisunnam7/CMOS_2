#CMOS -CIRCUIT DESIGN AND SPICE SIMULATIONS IN SKY 130
This intensive 10-day workshop focused on CMOS circuit design and SPICE simulation using SKY130 130nm technology. The course was structured progressively, enabling participants to build a strong foundation in MOSFET physics, CMOS inverter design, switching behavior, noise analysis, and variation effects.

The training emphasized both theoretical derivations and practical SPICE-based simulations to understand real-world transistor-level circuit behavior.

#DAY 1
*Basics of NMOS structure and operation ,Understanding Drain Current (Id) and Drain-to-Source Voltage (Vds) Regions of operation (Cutoff, Linear, Saturation)
